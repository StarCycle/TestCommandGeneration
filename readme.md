# Use Reinforcement Learning to Test Onboard Software of Small Satellites
This is the repository for the following work:

_Li, Z. (2022). Use Reinforcement Learning to Generate Testing Commands for Onboard Software of Small Satellites._
### Note

 - I will continue to organize the repository. However, because of the well-known network connection problem in China, currently I cannot directly push my local repository to Github...
 -  This repository cannot be directly used for your application. However, I provide some other repositories which can be good starting points for similar projects. They are [SimplePPO](https://github.com/StarCycle/SimplePPO), [pq9cov](https://github.com/StarCycle/CodeCoverage), and [GraphExtract](https://github.com/StarCycle/GraphExtract).
